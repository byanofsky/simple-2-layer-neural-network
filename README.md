# simple-2-layer-neural-network
A simple 2 layer neural network built with Numpy.

All credit goes to Andrew Trask for his post
[A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python (Part 1)](http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/).

I simply followed his instructions to learn how to build Neural Network from scratch.
